Coding guidelines
-----------

Its not fun to always have to stick to a set of rules, but here are are few to make sure everyone gets the best experience.
* Have verbose commit messages, this makes it much easier to revert commits if the need arises.
* Rebase your commits onto the tracked branch. No merges please.
* Use for spaces, NO tabs.
* Use lombok wherever possible.
